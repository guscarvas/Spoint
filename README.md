# Spoint - BackEnd -> Instructions:

## Hello Guys! Welcome to our Github Repository!
Think about it as a google drive for our code, it will help us keep eerything organized and also be able to go back to previous versions in case we need to.

I'm not going to lie, there will be a bit of a learning curve initially but don't worry, it's less complicated than you think and I'm here to help

## First Steps
### 1 - Download git from this site https://git-scm.com/downloads
If you need any help during the instalation just ask me, I'm happy to help :)

### 2 - Create your github account - https://github.com/
Register an account so I can add you to the repository (our drive)

### 3 - Send me a message so I can add you to the contributors

### 4 - Clone the repository in your computer
The way github works is you will clone what is on the repository on to your computer and afterwards you make changes to the code locally and when you're done you send your changes back to github through a few commands which I'll list at the end.

#### How to clone the repository 
Pick a folder where you want our program to be, when you're inside the folder right-click and click on "git bash here", a window kind of like a command prompt will show up, then write the command "git clone https://github.com/guscarvas/Spoint-BackEnd", this will copy everything uploaded until now to your computer. Congratulations you've just cloned your first repository!

### 5 - Start coding! 
When you're done coding for a while or just finished an important part it is good practice to "commit" these changes to our online version, so how do we do this?

git add * --- This tells git that we want to add all the changes we made to our upload

git commit -m "<write a message here which explains what you've done>" --- this creates the update we will send to our online repository

git push origin master --- this sends the update

### Important observations!!
Always run this command before you start coding in your computer:

git pull --- This command updates your local repository with all the changes that have been uploaded by everyone, this way you're up to date and we're less likely to run into any conflicts with the files

### That's it! If any errors show up, don't think twice about asking for help!
